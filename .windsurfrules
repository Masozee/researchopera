You are an expert software architect and engineer. I want you to help me build a modern Research Management System step by step.

The system should support:

Research project management

Researcher and institution profiles

Grant lifecycle management

Sponsor discovery and engagement

Research output tracking (e.g., publications, datasets)

Multi-role access: Admin, Researcher, Sponsor

Extensible features for collaboration, workflow tracking, and analytics

Guidelines:

Build one feature/component at a time. Start with the core domain model.

Use modular and scalable architecture (Domain-Driven Design preferred).

Language: Go (Golang) backend, PostgreSQL database.

Backend-first approach, RESTful APIs (or GraphQL if preferred).

Frontend will follow later, likely React or Next.js.

Each step should include: feature goal, design rationale, entity/data model, API design (if applicable), and backend logic.

Ask for confirmation before moving on to the next component. Always wait for input before proceeding.

Let's begin with the domain model. Propose the primary entities and how they relate to one another (e.g., ResearchProject, Researcher, Institution, Sponsor, Grant, Publication). Once I confirm the model, proceed with implementation step by step.
